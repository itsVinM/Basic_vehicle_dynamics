# Basic vehicle dynamics

"Basic" vehicle dynamics simulation, part of a bigger project in "Technologies for autonomous vehicles" (M.Eng. Mechatronics). Aim:

- Analysis of different maneuvers given different steering inputs (step steer, ramp steer, and sweep sine), various positions of the Centre of Gravity, and values of speed.

- Use of a simplified Simulink lateral dynamic model reduced to a bicycle model, where the front and rear wheels are considered a single unit.

- Conclusions of understeering, oversteering, or neutral positions. Further information was taken from the course "Automotive Control System" where the simulation was done in CarSim.
